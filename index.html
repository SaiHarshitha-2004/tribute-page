    <h3 id="title">Subhash Chandra Bose- An Unsung Hero</h3>
    <p>Whenever we hear the name Subhash Chandra Bose, the first thing that comes in our mind is a popular saying by him, 
        <p class="high">“Tum Mujhe Khoon do main tumhe Azadi dunga”.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
        Subhash Chandra Bose was born in Cuttack, Orissa, in 1897. He grew up deeply identifying with the Indian Freedom Movement and subsequently became a part of it in the 1920s. 


        He led a radical wing of the Indian National Congress (INC) throughout the 1920s and 1930s and eventually gained enough popularity and support to rise to a position of leadership in the INC.
         He eventually became the Congress President in 1938, but ended up leaving the party in 1939 because of a difference of opinion with the rest of the Congress leadership.

            After his resignation from the Congress, he was placed under house arrest by the ruling British Government, but managed to escape India in 1940.
            Upon his escape, he made his way to Germany by 1941, where he secured the sympathy and help of the Nazi party in his plan to overthrow the British Occupation.
            <p>
                With help from Germany's ally Japan, he Bose headed the Indian National Army (INA) which attempted to "conquer" parts of India, thereby freeing those areas from British Occupation.
                This attempt eventually failed and in 1945, the INA was soundly defeated by the British forces. 
               Despite his failure at leading a military revolt against the British Occupation, Bose was extremely successful in another area.

                In 1941, a Free India Radio was set up with help from Germany, on which Bose regularly spoke about the Indian Freedom Movement.
                Due to his charisma and charm, he succeeded in generating a wave of support for the Indian Freedom Movement.

            Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of inspiration for the struggle against the British.
            Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days.
             <p>
                The fresh interpretation of India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him.Some scholars think that Hindu spirituality formed an essential part of his political and social thought.
                As historian Leonard Gordon explains "Inner religious explorations continued to be a part of his adult life.

                This set him apart from the slowly growing number of atheistic socialists and communists who dotted the Indian landscape.
                Bose first expressed his preference for "a synthesis of what modern Europe calls socialism and fascism" in a 1930 speech in Calcutta.
              Bose later criticized Nehru's 1933 statement that there is "no middle road" between communism and fascism, describing it as "fundamentally wrong." 
             </p> 
          Bose believed communism would not gain ground in India due to its rejection of nationalism and religion and suggested a "synthesis between communism and fascism" could take hold instead.
          In 1944, Bose similarly stated, "Our philosophy should be a synthesis between National Socialism and communism."

        In 2021, the Government of India declared 23 January as Parakram Divas to commemorate the birth anniversary of Subhas Chandra Bose.
        Political party, Trinamool Congress and the All India Forward Bloc demanded that the day should be observed as 'Deshprem Divas'.
        A holographic statue of Bose at the India Gate to mark his 125th birth anniversary was installed at India Gate and a permanent granite statue replaced the holographic statue later.
